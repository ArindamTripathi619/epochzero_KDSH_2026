Validation Failure Analysis - 35% Accuracy
Critical Issue: Performance Degradation
Previous Baseline: 65.0% accuracy
Current Result: 35.0% accuracy (28/80 correct)
Delta: -30 percentage points ❌

Root Cause Analysis
1. Overfitting to "Contradict" Label
Looking at the sample mismatches:

ID 46 (Thalcave): True=consistent, Pred=0 (contradict)
ID 137 (Faria): True=contradict, Pred=1 (consistent)
ID 74 (Kai-Koumou): True=consistent, Pred=0 (contradict)
The system appears to be over-predicting contradictions (label=0), which means our "Aggressive Contradiction Search" (Stage 1) is flagging too many false positives, and Stage 2 is not filtering them effectively.

2. Programmatic Reasoning Too Strict
The constraint rules (imprisonment, death, location conflicts) may be triggering on weak signals or ambiguous phrasing, causing the system to reject valid backstories.

3. Evidence Reranking Disruption
The 
rerank_by_contradiction_relevance
 UDF may be over-prioritizing conflict-related chunks at the expense of supporting evidence, creating a biased evidence set that makes consistent backstories appear contradictory.

4. Query Expansion Noise
The expanded queries may be retrieving irrelevant chunks that introduce noise, confusing the LLM's judgment.

5. Confidence Calibration Not Used
While we added confidence scoring, we're not actually using it to filter borderline cases, so it's not helping accuracy.

Specific Failure Patterns
From the rationales:

ID 46: "does not contain any explicit or implicit contradictions" → Yet predicted 0 (contradict)
ID 137: "no specific evidence found" → Yet predicted 1 (consistent) when it should be 0
ID 74: "no specific evidence found" → Yet predicted 0 (contradict)
This suggests the system is inconsistent in handling "silence" cases.

Recommendations
Immediate Fixes (High Priority)
Disable Programmatic Constraints Temporarily: Comment out the entity tracker, timeline validator, and constraint rules to isolate their impact.
Revert Evidence Reranking: Test without reranking to see if it's causing the evidence quality to degrade.
Simplify Query Expansion: Use only the original query (disable expansion) to reduce noise.
Tune Dual-Pass Thresholds: The "Aggressive Search" may be too aggressive. Increase the confidence threshold for Stage 2 validation.
Medium-Term Improvements
Calibrated Filtering: Use the confidence scores to reject predictions below a threshold (e.g., confidence="Low" → abstain or default to consistent).
Error Analysis: Manually review 10-20 failures to understand specific failure modes.
Ablation Study: Test each component individually to measure its contribution to accuracy.
Long-Term Strategy
Supervised Fine-Tuning: If accuracy remains low, consider fine-tuning the local LLM on a curated dataset of consistent/contradict examples.
Ensemble Voting: Run both the baseline (65%) and the enhanced system, using majority voting for final predictions.
Next Steps
✅ Document this failure clearly
⬜ Revert to baseline implementation (65% accuracy)
⬜ Test components individually via ablation
⬜ Re-implement improvements incrementally with validation after each change
⬜ Update Project_Report.md with final accuracy (likely reverting to 65%)
